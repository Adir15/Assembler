# Assembler
The next program is an assembler (although with data and values different from the regular assembler, but works just like it)

A file containing the source file after the pre-assembler stage. 
A file containing the addresses in the machine code in which there is an information word that encodes the value of an icon declared as external. 
A file containing the memory image of the machine code. 
A file containing details of each symbol declared as an entry point.
