The next program is an assembler (although with data and values different from the regular assembler, but works just like it)

We will first insert the source file containing the assembly language

A file containing the source file after the pre-assembler stage. 
A file containing the addresses in the machine code in which there is an information word that encodes the value of an icon declared as external.

A file containing details of each symbol declared as an entry point.
